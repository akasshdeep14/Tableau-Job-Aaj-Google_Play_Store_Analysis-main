Key Insights from the Analysis
Ratings vs Installs
•	High ratings don’t always mean high installs — popularity and quality don’t always grow together.
•	Apps with moderate to high installs usually maintain more stable ratings.
•	Extremely popular apps often show rating fluctuations due to:
o	Large and diverse user bases
o	Higher expectations
o	Challenges in scaling quality
