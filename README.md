### Google Play Store Analysis

The project is a comprehensive Data Analysis Dashboard focused on the Google Play Store ecosystem. It translates raw app data into visual insights to help developers or market analysts understand competition, pricing strategies, and user preferences across various categories.

## What I Did — Key Analysis Highlights

Market Distribution Analysis
I analyzed app volume across major categories (e.g., Family, Game, Tools), finding that Family and Game dominate the marketplace.

Pricing Strategy Comparison
I compared Free vs. Paid apps and discovered that most apps are free, while certain niches such as Medical and Family support stronger paid models.

Content Rating Segmentation
I examined target audience distribution and found that apps are primarily targeted at Everyone, followed by Teen and Everyone 10+ segments.

Installation & Popularity Trends
I explored the relationship between app categories and install counts to identify high-growth and high-demand sectors.

Rating Performance Analysis
I evaluated average ratings across categories, noting that Education apps tend to achieve higher user satisfaction than categories like Tools.
Key Insights - 

High ratings don't guarantee installs, as scalability challenges cause variability in top apps; moderate installs correlate with stable ratings. Education, Productivity, and Books & Reference genres lead in satisfaction due to targeted user alignment. Lightweight apps outperform larger ones in downloads, especially competitively.

## Tools & Technologies Used


Based on the visual style and common workflows for this specific dataset:

Tableau: The primary tool used for creating the interactive dashboard, utilizing features like Treemaps (for categories), Pie Charts (for pricing), and Horizontal Bar Charts (for ratings).

Excel / CSV: Likely used as the initial data source
​

Dashboard Features - 

Global filters for Category, App Type, and Content Rating enable dynamic segment exploration. Update trends confirm regular releases boost engagement, visualized via time-series charts. Layout prioritizes interactivity for benchmarking and cross-market analysis.

Strategic Benefits - 

Developers can benchmark top performers, optimize size under 50MB, prioritize high-satisfaction genres, and balance updates with quality. Product managers gain tools for growth vs. retention trade-offs, transforming data into sustainable strategies.
​

Implementation Value - 

Interactive visuals in Tableau streamline raw data into actionable views, mirroring proven app store analyses that emphasize maintenance and niche focus for long-term success.
