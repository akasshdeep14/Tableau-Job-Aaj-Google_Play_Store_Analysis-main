### Google Play Store Analysis

This Tableau dashboard project on Google Play Store apps effectively visualizes key success drivers like ratings, installs, updates, and genres for strategic decision-making. It builds on common patterns seen in app analytics, where factors like size and maintenance influence growth beyond raw popularity.

Education, Productivity, and Books & Reference genres lead in satisfaction due to targeted user alignment. Lightweight apps outperform larger ones in downloads, especially competitively.
​

Dashboard Features - 

Global filters for Category, App Type, and Content Rating enable dynamic segment exploration. Update trends confirm regular releases boost engagement, visualized via time-series charts. Layout prioritizes interactivity for benchmarking and cross-market analysis.

Strategic Benefits - 

Developers can benchmark top performers, optimize size under 50MB, prioritize high-satisfaction genres, and balance updates with quality. Product managers gain tools for growth vs. retention trade-offs, transforming data into sustainable strategies.
​

Implementation Value -
